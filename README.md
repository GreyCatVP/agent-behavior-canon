# Agent Behavior Canon

A minimal engineering standard for production-grade LLM agents.

This canon defines **how agents must behave**, not what they generate.

Core principles:
- mode discipline (DISCUSS / EXECUTE)
- read-before-write
- small diffs
- stop rules
- one-task scope

Designed to be **enforceable**, not inspirational.
